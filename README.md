## Qwik In Depth Course

This repository contains the code of the Qwik In Depth Course.

IMPORTANT: please use Node 18 (Long-term support version) to take this course.

# Instructions for taking this course

If you want, you can install the course code and code along as you go through the course. 

Notice that this is optional, the course will still make perfect sense if you choose to just watch it and not code along as you go.

But coding along is one of the best ways to learn, so I encourage you to try it out.  

This section teaches you how to get your local development environment up and running, so that you can comfortably learn the framework in a stable environment.

This repository provides you with a playground environment with everything you need, including a backend server that you will use during the course.

This repository contains a few branches:

- the 1-start branch is the starting point of the course

- the main branch contains the finished version of the code. You should refer to this branch in case of doubts with any of the imports, and to compare your code with the finished code.

# How To install the course code

Start by cloning the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/qwik-courses/qwik-course.git
    cd qwik-course

Then switch to the 1-start branch:

    git checkout 1-start

Install your dependencies:

    npm install

# To Run the Development Backend Server

We can start the sample application backend with the following command:

    npm run server

This is a small Node REST API server.

# To run the Development UI Server

To run the frontend part of our code, run the following command:

    npm start
